<h1>Node.js</h1>
<p class="container">Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing
  server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript,
  and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.
  Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the
  development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.</p>

<h1>Express.js</h1>
<p class="container">Express is a framework of Node.js that allows you to use several very useful
   and powerful features without having to reinvent the wheel, helps you organize
   your application's routing and use any templating solution with minimal effort.
   It also allows for much better organization of your code.</p>

<h1>Sockets.io</h1>
<p class = "container">Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime,
   bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side
   library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have
   a nearly identical API. Like Node.js, it is event-driven. Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket
   protocol with polling as a fallback option, while providing the same interface. Although it can
   be used as simply a wrapper for WebSocket, it provides many more features, including broadcasting
   to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O. It can be installed
   with the npm tool.</p>
