Exploration2-Node-Express-Sockets
======================

This is my second exploration that I wrote using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Sockets.io**. These three libraries are all client side libraries and with using all three, you are able to do real time interaction between seperate computers.

Dependencies and Installs
===============
```shell
npm --version
```
